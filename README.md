# PatternRecognition
Benchmarking GTSRB for Few Shot Learning.

We took help from this [git repo](https://github.com/sicara/easy-few-shot-learning). All the codes are done on google colab other than CD. You can download and run without downloading anything.

Our results on GTSRB as base dataset (used 25 classes) and target dataset (used 18 classes).
